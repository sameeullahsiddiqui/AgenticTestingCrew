    - Validate page categorization (dashboard, data management, configuration, etc.)
    - Check for comprehensive page-level analysis completion
    
    ✓ **UI Element Analysis Validation**:
    - Verify each page has complete actionable element inventory
    - Confirm button, link, icon, and form element documentation
    - Validate tab system exploration and content mapping
    - Check data grid analysis with row-level action documentation
    
    ✓ **Recursive Exploration Validation**:
    - Confirm safe actions were executed to discover child pages/content
    - Verify parent-child page relationships are properly mapped
    - Check modal dialog and popup content discovery
    - Validate action-result documentation completeness
    
    ✓ **User Journey Mapping Validation**:
    - Verify comprehensive workflow documentation exists
    - Confirm end-to-end process mapping from menu to completion
    - Validate business value context for each major journey
    - Check inter-page relationship and transition documentation
    
    ✓ **Evidence Package Validation**:
    - Verify screenshot evidence for all major pages and interfaces
    - Confirm HTML source snapshots for technical verification
    - Check comprehensive logging and error documentation
    - Validate navigation path instructions for reproducibility
    
    ✓ **Blazor-Specific Analysis Validation**:
    - Confirm component interaction patterns were documented
    - Verify dynamic content loading behavior analysis
    - Check tab system interdependencies and relationships
    - Validate grid-to-detail page flow documentation
    
    ✓ **Error and Edge Case Documentation**:
    - Verify all navigation errors were logged and categorized
    - Confirm broken links and non-functional elements documented  
    - Check UI/UX issues and accessibility problems recorded
    - Validate troubleshooting context provided for each error
    
    ✓ **Business Context and Value Validation**:
    - Confirm each page's business purpose is clearly documented
    - Verify user value proposition is explained for major features
    - Check workflow context and process understanding
    - Validate feature prioritization based on business importance
    
    FAILURE CONDITIONS - REQUIRE RETRY:
    - Less than {TARGET_PAGES} unique pages discovered
    - Navigation hierarchy incomplete or inaccurate
    - Missing actionable element analysis on any page
    - Insufficient recursive exploration depth
    - Inadequate user journey documentation
    - Missing evidence package components
    - Incomplete error documentation

review_discovery:
  title: "Discovery Review Task"
  content: |
    Review comprehensive discovery outcome and validation results to determine if the Blazor application 
    exploration meets all requirements and quality standards for proceeding to test planning phase.
    
    REVIEW CRITERIA - ALL MUST BE SATISFIED:
    
    **Critical Success Factors:**
    - Login authentication was successful and maintained throughout exploration
    - MINIMUM {TARGET_PAGES}+ unique pages/screens discovered and documented
    - Complete left navigation hierarchy mapped with all menu/submenu items
    - Comprehensive UI element analysis completed for each page
    - Recursive safe action execution performed to discover child content
    - User journey mapping covers major application workflows
    
    **Quality Assessment:**
    - Navigation completeness score meets standards (90%+ coverage)
    - Page analysis depth is sufficient for test case generation
    - Business context is clearly documented for all major features
    - Error documentation provides actionable troubleshooting information
    - Evidence package (screenshots, HTML, logs) is comprehensive
    
    **Blazor-Specific Requirements:**
    - Tab system exploration is thorough with content mapping
    - Data grid analysis includes row-level actions and operations
    - Component interaction patterns are documented
    - Dynamic loading behavior is analyzed and recorded
    - Modal dialog workflows are mapped and understood
    
    **Readiness for Test Planning:**
    - Sufficient page diversity for comprehensive test case creation
    - Clear understanding of application business flows and user journeys
    - Actionable element inventory supports detailed test script generation
    - Error conditions and edge cases identified for negative testing
    - Application architecture and navigation patterns understood
    
    DECISION LOGIC:
    - **APPROVED**: All validation criteria passed, {TARGET_PAGES}+ pages discovered, comprehensive analysis complete
    - **APPROVED with Notes**: Minor gaps identified but sufficient for test planning, document recommendations
    - **RETRY Required**: Critical requirements not met, insufficient page coverage, or major analysis gaps
