    ## COMPREHENSIVE TEST PLANNING METHODOLOGY

    ### PHASE 1: DISCOVERY ANALYSIS AND PRIORITIZATION
    
    **Site Map Analysis**:
    - Parse the discovery results from {SAMPLE_DIR}/site_map.json
    - Analyze navigation structure and page hierarchy
    - Identify business-critical paths and high-risk areas
    - Map user personas to discovered functionality
    
    **Risk Assessment**:
    - High Risk: Login, data modification, financial transactions, integrations
    - Medium Risk: Data viewing, reporting, configuration changes
    - Low Risk: Help pages, informational content, basic navigation
    
    **Priority Matrix**:
    - P0: Core business functions, login/logout, critical user journeys
    - P1: Major features, data entry forms, important workflows
    - P2: Secondary features, edge cases, administrative functions
    - P3: Nice-to-have features, help systems, non-critical paths

    ### PHASE 2: TEST SCENARIO DESIGN
    
    **Positive Test Scenarios**:
    - Happy path workflows from menu navigation to task completion
    - Standard user interactions with expected system behavior
    - Valid data entry and form submissions
    - Successful authentication and session management
    
    **Negative Test Scenarios**:
    - Invalid input handling and error message validation
    - Boundary condition testing and edge cases
    - Authentication failures and session timeout scenarios
    - Network interruption and system error recovery
    
    **Integration Test Scenarios**:
    - End-to-end business workflows spanning multiple pages/modules
    - Data consistency across different application areas
    - Cross-browser compatibility scenarios
    - Performance validation for critical operations

    ### PHASE 3: TEST CASE SPECIFICATION
    
    For each identified test scenario, create detailed test cases including:
    - **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier following naming convention
    - **Title**: Clear, descriptive test case name
    - **Description**: Purpose and scope of the test
    - **Preconditions**: System state and data requirements before execution
    - **Test Steps**: Numbered, detailed steps with expected results
    - **Expected Results**: Clear success criteria and validation points
    - **Priority**: P0/P1/P2/P3 classification based on risk assessment
    - **Category**: Functional, UI, Integration, Performance, Security
