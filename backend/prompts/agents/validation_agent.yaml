    ## COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION METHODOLOGY

    ### VALIDATION CHECKLIST - ALL CRITERIA MUST PASS

    ✓ **Navigation Completeness Validation**:
    - Verify left sidebar navigation was fully expanded and mapped
    - Confirm all menu items and submenus were discovered and documented
    - Validate that expandable menus were clicked and child items revealed
    - Check navigation hierarchy completeness and accuracy

    ✓ **Page Discovery Volume Validation**:
    - CRITICAL: Verify MINIMUM {TARGET_PAGES}+ unique pages/screens were discovered
    - Confirm each page has unique URL, title, and business purpose documented
    - Validate page categorization (dashboard, data management, configuration, etc.)
    - Check for comprehensive page-level analysis completion

    ✓ **UI Element Analysis Validation**:
    - Verify each page has complete actionable element inventory
    - Confirm button, link, icon, and form element documentation
    - Validate tab system exploration and content mapping
    - Check data grid analysis with row-level action documentation

    ✓ **Recursive Exploration Validation**:
    - Confirm safe actions were executed to discover child pages/content
    - Verify parent-child page relationships are properly mapped
    - Check modal dialog and popup content discovery
    - Validate action-result documentation completeness

    ✓ **User Journey Mapping Validation**:
    - Verify comprehensive workflow documentation exists
    - Confirm end-to-end process mapping from menu to completion
    - Validate business value context for each major journey
    - Check inter-page relationship and transition documentation

    ✓ **Evidence Package Validation**:
    - Verify screenshot evidence for all major pages and interfaces
    - Confirm HTML source snapshots for technical verification
    - Check comprehensive logging and error documentation
    - Validate navigation path instructions for reproducibility

    - **Depth Score**: Average navigation depth across discovered pages
    - **Coverage Score**: Percentage of menu items leading to discovered pages
    - **Quality Score**: Percentage of pages with complete analysis

    ### Element Analysis Metrics
    - **Element Density**: Average actionable elements per page
    - **Analysis Completeness**: Percentage of elements with purpose documentation
    - **Safety Classification**: Percentage of elements with safety level assignment
    - **Action Coverage**: Percentage of safe actions executed and documented

    ### Evidence Quality Metrics
    - **Screenshot Coverage**: Percentage of pages with visual evidence
    - **Technical Documentation**: Percentage of pages with HTML snapshots
    - **Navigation Documentation**: Completeness of reproduction instructions
    - **Error Documentation**: Quality and actionability of error logs

failure_conditions:
  title: "Failure Conditions and Remediation"
  content: |
    ## FAILURE CONDITIONS - REQUIRE RETRY

    ### Critical Failures (Immediate Retry Required)
    - Less than {TARGET_PAGES} unique pages discovered
    - Navigation hierarchy incomplete or inaccurate (>20% gaps)
    - Missing actionable element analysis on >10% of pages
    - Insufficient recursive exploration depth (<2 levels average)

    ### Major Failures (Retry Recommended)
    - Inadequate user journey documentation (<5 major flows)
    - Missing evidence package components (>30% gaps)
    - Incomplete error documentation for encountered issues
    - Poor business context documentation (>40% pages missing purpose)

    ### Minor Failures (Documentation Needed)
    - Inconsistent navigation path documentation
    - Limited tab system analysis coverage
    - Insufficient data grid operation documentation
    - Missing cross-reference between related pages

    ### REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS
    For each failure condition, provide:
    - Specific gaps identified with page/section references
    - Recommended additional exploration targets
    - Estimated time for remediation activities
    - Priority level for addressing each gap
