    Systematically explore and document every accessible menu, submenu, page, and UI element in the web application at {BASE_URL}.
    Ensure complete coverage of all known menu items and a minimum of {TARGET_PAGES}+ unique pages.

  title: "ðŸš¨ Execute All Browser Tools - Minimal LLM Usage ðŸš¨"
  content: |
    ## EXECUTION STRATEGY:
    - Execute every browser tool in the task sequence
    - Use minimal responses: "Done", "Next", "âœ“", "Screenshot taken"
    - Do NOT stop until all 34+ browser_take_screenshot calls complete
    - Save using File Writer Tool after every 5 screenshots
    
    ## ANTI-EARLY-TERMINATION:
    - Count screenshots: Must reach p34.png minimum  
    - Task FAILS if stopped before p34+ completion
    - NO final answer until ALL browser tools executed
    
    ## RESPONSE PATTERN:
    Tool: browser_navigate â†’ "âœ“"
    Tool: browser_take_screenshot â†’ "Screenshot p1 done. Progress: 1/34+"  
    Tool: browser_click â†’ "âœ“"
    Tool: File Writer Tool â†’ "Progress saved"
    
    ## COMPLETION RULE:
    Only generate final JSON output after executing all 34+ browser tools.
    ```
    1. browser_navigate to base URL
    2. browser_click on "Projects" 
    3. browser_take_screenshot (expanded menu)
    4. browser_click on "Scoping"
    5. browser_take_screenshot (Scoping page)
    6. Continue for all 5 Projects children
    ```

    **REPEAT for all parent menus until 34+ child pages discovered**

    ### EXPLICIT ACTION REQUIREMENTS:
    - **You MUST click on each parent menu item** (Administration, Master Data Setup, Projects, etc.)
    - **You MUST capture screenshots** of both expanded menus and accessed pages
    - **You MUST navigate back to base URL** after each child page visit
    - **You MUST continue until all known menu items are attempted**
    
    ### FAILURE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE:
    - DO NOT stop after discovering only the dashboard
    - DO NOT skip menu expansion
    - DO NOT make assumptions about menu accessibility
    - DO NOT complete until 30+ unique pages are documented

    ### SUCCESS CRITERIA ENFORCEMENT:
    Your discovery is ONLY complete when:
    âœ“ 34+ child menu pages successfully accessed
    âœ“ All 6 Administration child items attempted  
    âœ“ All 10 Master Data Setup child items attempted
    âœ“ All 5 Projects child items attempted
    âœ“ All 4 Workplans child items attempted  
    âœ“ All other parent menu children attempted
    âœ“ Evidence (screenshots) captured for each accessible page
    âœ“ Navigation sequences documented for reproducibility

    **If you discover less than 30 pages, you have FAILED the task.**

  title: "Navigation & Progress Logging"

    - **Menu Expansion Log**: "EXPANDING: [Parent Menu] â†’ Found [X] child items: [list]"
    - **Navigation Log**: "NAVIGATING: Base URL â†’ [Parent Menu] â†’ [Child Menu] â†’ Page Loaded"
    - **Page Discovery Log**: "PAGE #X: [Name] - [URL] - [Navigation Path] - [Business Purpose]"
    - **Coverage Tracking**: "COVERAGE: X of 34+ expected child menus explored"
    - **Screenshot Evidence**: "CAPTURED: [menu_state].png, [page_name].png"
    - **Reset Confirmation**: "RESET: Returned to base URL, menu state cleared"
    - **Missing Item Log**: "MISSING: [Expected Menu Item] not found in [Parent Menu]"
    
    **Critical Checkpoints**:
    - After each parent menu expansion: Confirm all expected child items visible
    - After each child navigation: Confirm successful return to base URL  
    - Before final completion: Verify all known_menu_inventory items attempted

success_criteria:
  title: "Enhanced Completion Checklist"
  content: |
    âœ“ **Navigation Strategy**: Smart collapse-handling pattern implemented
    âœ“ **Base URL Reset**: Successfully return to base URL after each child menu navigation
    âœ“ **Parent Menu Coverage**: All parent menus identified and expanded 
    âœ“ **Child Menu Discovery**: All known child menu items from inventory attempted
    âœ“ **Page Access Success**: 34+ child menu pages successfully accessed and captured
    âœ“ **Evidence Collection**: Screenshots captured for each expanded menu state and accessed page
    âœ“ **HTML Snapshots**: Complete DOM captured for each accessible page
    âœ“ **Navigation Sequences**: Exact navigation paths documented for reproducibility
    âœ“ **INCREMENTAL SAVES**: discovery_summary.json saved after every 5 screenshots using File Writer Tool
    âœ“ **FINAL JSON OUTPUT**: Complete discovery_summary.json saved at task completion
    
    **MANDATORY SAVE PATTERN**:
    - After p5.png, p10.png, p15.png, p20.png, etc.: Use File Writer Tool
    - filename: "discovery_summary.json"
    - directory: "backend/fs_files/run_20250820_143000/" 
    - content: Complete JSON discovery output with all pages found so far
    âœ“ **Coverage Validation**: Cross-referenced against known_menu_inventory.yaml
    âœ“ **Missing Items Documented**: Any inaccessible or missing menu items properly logged
    âœ“ **Target Achievement**: {TARGET_PAGES}+ unique pages discovered and documented
    
    **FAILURE CONDITIONS TO AVOID**:
    âœ— Accessing only 1-2 pages due to menu collapse issues
    âœ— Not expanding parent menus before clicking child items  
    âœ— Failing to return to base URL between child menu navigations
    âœ— Missing large sections of known menu inventory
